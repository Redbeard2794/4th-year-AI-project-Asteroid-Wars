Requirements</h1>
<p>Asteroid Wars You must produce the game “Asteroid Wars”. This is a single player shoot 'em up. The aim of the game is to destroy all other ships.</p>
<p>The player’s ship is controlled using the left, right and up arrows. Left and right arrows cause the chip to turn anticlockwise and clockwise respectively. The up arrow applies thrust to the ship in the direction it is pointing. The space bar fires a bullet. Enemy entities come in different guises and display differing behaviour.</p>
<p>Factories These produce predators while actively trying to evade the player. They can survive four hits from the player. When the player’s ship is within range they will take evasive behaviour, otherwise they wander at random. If factories meet they will flock. A factory will fire interceptor guided missiles at the player once the player is within range. Interceptor missiles have the same maximum speed as the player and will explode if they do not reach the player within 10 seconds. A factory can only have five interceptor missiles “live” at a time.</p>
<p>Swarm Boids These swarm in groups and tend towards the players ship. Once they are within range of the ship they then plot an intercept course for the ship.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_predator.html">Predator</a> Ships These seek out the player and intelligently engage them. They have the same firepower as the player ship. Predators move in flocks and can also collect “powerups”!</p>
<p>Obstacles Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>Power-ups To be decided by individual game designers. Friction operates in the game and any moving object will slow down over time if thrust is not applied to it. All entities try to avoid obstacles. Collision with an obstacle results in death.</p>
<p>The screen should scroll so that the player’s ship is always in the centre of the screen. The game is wrap around with the total area of play 9 times that of a single screen. Radar will be provided for the player</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="factory"></a>
Factory</h2>
<p>The Factory ships within the current build of the game works on a three state AI state machine:</p>
<p>Evade: Causes the factory ship to strategicly retreat from the player. The Factory calculates any direction thats not towards the player aka in a 180 degree circle away and plots a random path and evades. But if the player is trying to exit the evade circle the factory ship tries its best to keep them within this radius as it is also the firing range for the Interceptor Missles.</p>
<p>Flee: Is purely for self preservation if the player ship gets too close to the factory ship or has taken enough damage the ship begins to head directly away from the player. Is would be the strategy when the ship is in combat has fired missles and spawned a handful of ships now it must retreat and save its streght.</p>
<p>Wander: Plots a random location close to the ships current position and travels there, when enough time has passed or the ship reaches its destination a new point is ploted this is for wandering around the world.</p>
<p>The factorys are responsable for there own interceptor missles and must fire them on a cool down time. Each Factory loads 3 missles into memory as that is the maximum that can be active at a time and just recycles them in game. When the factories are destroyed the Missles they are responsable for are still updated until they are no longer active. Factories are meant to be large motherships in our game hence they move slowly but have alot of firepower and Obstacles ricochet off the hull of the ship.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="predatorController"></a>
PredatorController</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_predator.html">Predator</a> Controller is responsible for creating, rendering and updateing all the predators within the game. This simple Handler class is used to seperate the factory code from the predator. Similary The predators are responsable for there own bullets as do the Factories.</p>
