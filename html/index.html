Requirements</h1>
<p>Asteroid Wars You must produce the game “Asteroid Wars”. This is a single player shoot 'em up. The aim of the game is to destroy all other ships.</p>
<p>The player’s ship is controlled using the left, right and up arrows. Left and right arrows cause the chip to turn anticlockwise and clockwise respectively. The up arrow applies thrust to the ship in the direction it is pointing. The space bar fires a bullet. Enemy entities come in different guises and display differing behaviour.</p>
<p>Factories These produce predators while actively trying to evade the player. They can survive four hits from the player. When the player’s ship is within range they will take evasive behaviour, otherwise they wander at random. If factories meet they will flock. A factory will fire interceptor guided missiles at the player once the player is within range. Interceptor missiles have the same maximum speed as the player and will explode if they do not reach the player within 10 seconds. A factory can only have five interceptor missiles “live” at a time.</p>
<p>Swarm Boids These swarm in groups and tend towards the players ship. Once they are within range of the ship they then plot an intercept course for the ship.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_predator.html">Predator</a> Ships These seek out the player and intelligently engage them. They have the same firepower as the player ship. Predators move in flocks and can also collect “powerups”!</p>
<p>Obstacles Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>Powerups To be decided by individual game designers. Friction operates in the game and any moving object will slow down over time if thrust is not applied to it. All entities try to avoid obstacles. Collision with an obstacle results in death.</p>
<p>The screen should scroll so that the player’s ship is always in the centre of the screen. The game is wrap around with the total area of play 9 times that of a single screen. Radar will be provided for the player</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Beyond_sec"></a>
Beyond Requirements</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="factory"></a>
FactoryShip</h2>
<p>The Factory ships within the current build of the game works on a three state AI state machine:</p>
<p>Evade: Causes the factory ship to strategicly retreat from the player. The Factory calculates any direction thats not towards the player aka in a 180 degree circle away and plots a random path and evades. But if the player is trying to exit the evade circle the factory ship tries its best to keep them within this radius as it is also the firing range for the Interceptor Missles.</p>
<p>Flee: Is purely for self preservation if the player ship gets too close to the factory ship or has taken enough damage the ship begins to head directly away from the player. Is would be the strategy when the ship is in combat has fired missles and spawned a handful of ships now it must retreat and save its streght.</p>
<p>Wander: Plots a random location close to the ships current position and travels there, when enough time has passed or the ship reaches its destination a new point is ploted this is for wandering around the world. The <a class="el" href="class_factory_ship.html">FactoryShip</a> are responsable for there own interceptor missles and must fire them on a cool down time. Each Factory loads 3 missles into memory as that is the maximum that can be active at a time and just recycles them in game. When the factories are destroyed the Missles they are responsable for are still updated until they are no longer active. Factories are meant to be large motherships in our game hence they move slowly but have alot of firepower and Obstacles ricochet off the hull of the ship.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="predatorController"></a>
PredatorController</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_predator_controller.html">PredatorController</a> is responsible for creating, rendering and updateing all the predators within the game. This simple Handler class is used to seperate the factory code from the predator. Similary The predators are responsable for there own bullets as do the Factories.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="player"></a>
Player</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_player.html">Player</a> can be controlled using either W,A,S&amp;D or with the arrow keys. Pressing space allows the player to shoot. The player has 10 missiles they can fire before they have to wait for their guns to reload. As mentioned in the requirements the player accelerates and decelerates.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="hud"></a>
Hud</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_hud.html">Hud</a> displays several pieces of information to the player. It shows the player's current health status, current orientation, radar, active powerups and current ammunition.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="swarmboid"></a>
Swarmboid</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_swarm_boid.html">SwarmBoid</a> have 3 states, Swarm, Intercept and Evade.</p>
<p>Swarm: The swarmboids spawn in small groups around the world and move towards each other in order to swarm. They loosely swarm so that it doesn't look like one big blob of ufos. The swarm then tends towards the player when the swarm is fully established.</p>
<p>Intercept: If the player is near a swarmboid it will break out of the swarm and start to chase the player with the intention of crashing straight into the player in order to cause damage to the player. If the player gets out of range the swarmboid will return to the swarm.</p>
<p>Evade: If a swarmboid notices that there is an obstacle nearby and it is on a collision course with the swarm boid, the swarmboid will try to avoid the collision. They will leave the swarm and try to evade the first obstacle they noticed. They are not always successful and can get hit by a second obstacle while avoiding the first obstacle.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="powerup"></a>
Powerup</h2>
<p>There are 3 different types of <a class="el" href="class_powerup.html">Powerup</a> in this game: Health boost, Shield and Speed boost. Health boost increases the player's health, Shield stops the player taking damage for 6 seconds except for when they crash into an obstacle and Speed boost increases the player's top speed for 6 seconds. A new powerup is spawned by the powerupController every 5-15 seconds(its a random time between these 2 numbers). There can be a max of 10 powerups on screen at a time. If there is already 10 powerups on screen then a new powerup will not be spawned. Powerups are spawned in near the player.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="camera"></a>
Camera</h2>
<p>The Games <a class="el" href="classv_camera.html">vCamera</a> inherits from an sf::View and has bounds locking for when you begin to reach the edge of the world the camera ensures the player doesnt see beyond the background image</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="obstacles"></a>
Obstacles</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="class_obstacle.html">Obstacle</a> are represented by animated asteriod sprites. They move around the world with a random velocity. If they collide with any object such as the player or a predator, the object is destroyed. The only exception to this is the factory ship. If an obstacle collides with a factory ship it will bounce off of it and cause a small amount of damage to the factory. This was an intentional change to the requirements as the factory ships are represented by quite a large sprite and it didn't make sense for it to be destroyed by a smaller obstacle.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="interceptorMissle"></a>
Interceptor Missle</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_interceptor_missile.html">InterceptorMissile</a> works exactly as is outlined in the requirements.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="radar"></a>
Radar</h2>
<p>The radar was created using an sf::view. The radar shows player, the player's bullets, all enemies(factory, swarmboids, predators), obstacles and also any bullets fired in game. Each object is represented by a small icon on the radar.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="explosionController"></a>
ExplosionController</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_explosion_controller.html">ExplosionController</a> works in much the same way as the powerupController. The difference being that it adds an animated explosion whenever there is a collision. There are 4 types of explosion. The only difference between them is the spritesheet and how fast they are animated. When an explosion has reached the end of its spritesheet it fades out. Once it is fully transparent it is removed from the game. </p>
